`git pull origin master`
git pull origin master will pull changes from the origin remote, master branch and merge them to the local checked-out branch.

`git pull origin/master`
git pull origin/master will pull changes from the locally stored branch origin/master and merge that to the local checked-out branch. The origin/master branch is essentially a "cached copy" of what was last pulled from origin, which is why it's called a remote branch in git parlance. 

`git checkout -- <file>`
Discarding local changes (permanently) to a file

`git reset --hard`
Discard all local changes to all files permanently
